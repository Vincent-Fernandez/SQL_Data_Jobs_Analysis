Answer: What are the most optimal skills to learn (aka itâ€™s in high demand and a high-paying skill)?
- Identify skills in high demand and associated with high average salaries for Data Analyst roles
- Concentrates on remote positions with specified salaries
- Why? Targets skills that offer job security (high demand) and financial benefits (high salaries), 
    offering strategic insights for career development in data analysis

Here's a breakdown of the most optimal skills for Data Analysts in 2023: 

Among the top skills in demand, Apache Kafka stands out with a demand count of 40 and an average salary of $129,999. 
PyTorch follows with a demand count of 20 and an average salary of $125,226, while Perl and TensorFlow share a similar demand count of 20,
with average salaries of $124,686 and $120,647, respectively. Notably, skills like Apache Airflow and Scala, despite lower demand 
counts (71 and 59, respectively), offer competitive average salaries of $116,387 and $115,480, indicating their significance in specialized roles.
Furthermore, cloud technologies such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Snowflake demonstrate high demand counts (78 and 241, respectively),
correlating with slightly lower average salaries of $113,065 and $111,578. This suggests a robust demand for cloud-related skills but with
slightly less premium compensation compared to niche technologies like Kafka or PyTorch.
